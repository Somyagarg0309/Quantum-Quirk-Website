                    <h2><u>The Father of Theoretical Physics</u></h2>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Richard Feynman</u> was a Nobel-prizewinning US theoretical physicist. Famed for his
                            brilliant
                            mind and mercurial personality, his main work was in quantum physics and particle physics,
                            where
                            he
                            is particularly known for the Feynman diagram, a way of depicting particle processes
                            graphically.
                            But he was a prolific writer and thinker who also pioneered ideas in quantum computing and
                            nanotechnology. In his last years, he gained widespread public fame as a prominent and
                            outspoken
                            member of the commission investigating the fatal Challenger Space Shuttle disaster.

                            Feynman first made a scientific name for himself as a member of the Manhattan project to
                            build
                            the
                            nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 at the end of the second
                            world
                            war.</b>
